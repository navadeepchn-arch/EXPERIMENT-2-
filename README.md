# Experiment 2

## Title
Club all the experiments in Experiment 2 as a single experiment.

## Description
This project implements a modular experiment dashboard using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The dashboard serves as a launcher for three separate experiments:  
1. **Experiment 2.1 – Word Counter**  
2. **Experiment 2.2 – Product Filter**  
3. **Experiment 2.3 – Drawing Tool**  

The dashboard uses a responsive layout and an iframe to display each experiment without conflicts. Each experiment runs independently with its own CSS and JS.

## Learning Outcomes
- Design a modular launcher/dashboard for multiple web experiments.  
- Integrate separate HTML/CSS/JS files into a single interactive interface.  
- Use iframes to load independent experiments without CSS/JS conflicts.  
- Apply responsive design for dashboard layout.  
- Prepare submission-ready structured projects for lab and viva.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS variables)  
- JavaScript (ES6), DOM API
